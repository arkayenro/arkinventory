*1.45 (08-JUN-2007)*
  * fixed - bar frames/borders will display in edit mode when hidden

*1.43 (07-JUN-2007)*
  * fixed - player skills were only being read from the first character to login which effected default categorisation, they are now read every time a skill or profession changed (including at login)
  * added - option to hide the bar frames (to help get around the issue where DHUD appears to be pushing their frame levels too far up and my bar frames are ending up above the item frames)

{{{
  an alternate fix you can try - but will probably come back up if you have DHUD still loaded

  load up your character and open your bags, bank and keyring (doesn't matter if they're offline) and then enter the following into the chat window (one line at a time - copy and paste it)

  /script ARKINV_MainFrame1:SetFrameLevel( 3 )
  /script ARKINV_MainFrame2:SetFrameLevel( 3 )
  /script ARKINV_MainFrame3:SetFrameLevel( 3 )

  logout, log back in

  * Requires Ace2 (i didn't embed it)
