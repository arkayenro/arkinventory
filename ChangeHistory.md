# 3.10.05 Alpha 1 (16-NOV-2022)
 - fixed - battlepet tooltips showing during scanning
 - fixed - battlepets in the vault
 
# known issues
 - (dragonflight) reagentbank slots are no longer readable unless the bank is open
 - recipes on vendors are showing item counts for the items they create, not the recipe
 - (dragonflight) currency tokens on the backback no longer have a fixed amount and will keep going until you run out of space, they can get messy
 - Enum.ItemConsumableSubclass is missing the Flask entry and everything after has moved down a value which screws up the category names (have hardcoded a workaround in for the moment)
 - items with an active cooldown dont allow comparison tooltips to generate
 - all of the cooldown events ACTIONBAR_UPDATE_COOLDOWN, BAG_UPDATE_COOLDOWN, PET_BAR_UPDATE_COOLDOWN, SPELL_UPDATE_COOLDOWN, appear to trigger off other players as well, but do not provide any indication when the event was triggered by you or them, so cooldowns will trigger window refreshes fairly constantly when you are around large numbers of players (it has been limited to one per second for this reason)
 
# to do
 - double check all categories show/hide for the right clients
 - confirm things havent broken in classic, wrath, or shadowlands
 - restack disable - maybe change this to require a modifier key instead of a straight disable?  might be easier to shift/alt/ctrl click on it than turning it on/off and its not like youll accidentally do it (which is why the disable was added)
 - backpack tokens to scroll when max width reached on second line
 - extend the categoryset actions to individual items for additional granular control.
 - add action; bank (move from bank to bag)
 - add action; bag (move from bag to bank)
